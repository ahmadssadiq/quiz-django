Description: This file defines the URL routing for the Quiz application. 
It maps specific URL patterns to their corresponding view functions, enabling 
users to interact with different features of the application. The urlpatterns list
is used by Django to match incoming HTTP requests with appropriate views.

URL Patterns:
1. index: Root view of the application (home page).
2. sign_up: URL for user registration.
3. sign_in: URL for user login.
4. sign_out: URL for user logout.
5. create_quiz: URL for quiz creation.
6. play_quiz: URL to play a specific quiz, identified by quiz_id.
7. check_answer: URL to check the user's answer for a specific question, identified by question_id.
8. submit_quiz: URL to submit answers for a quiz, identified by quiz_id.
9. quiz_results: URL to display quiz results, showing the quiz_id, the user's score, and the total score.

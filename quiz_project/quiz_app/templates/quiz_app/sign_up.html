Description: This template renders the sign-up page for the Quiz App. It provides a registration form
for users to create a new account. The form includes fields for username, email, and password, as well
as CSRF protection for secure form submission. A link to the sign-in page is provided for users who
already have an account.

Key Features:
1. Extends the base template for consistent layout and styling across the app.
2. Dynamically renders a Django user registration form using the context variable `form`.
3. Includes CSRF protection for secure form submission.
4. Provides a sign-in link for existing users.

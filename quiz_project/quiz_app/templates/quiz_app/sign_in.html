Description: This template renders the sign-in page for the Quiz App. It provides a form for users to
log in using their credentials. The form includes fields for username and password, as well as CSRF
protection. A link to the sign-up page is also provided for users who don't already have an account.

Key Features:
1. Extends the base template for consistent layout and styling across the app.
2. Dynamically renders a Django authentication form using the context variable `form`.
3. Includes CSRF protection for secure form submission.
4. Provides a sign-up link for users who need to register.
